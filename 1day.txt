01/100day Linux Study

I started studying Linux and two distributions, currently Kali.

I use it on a VM, and Iâ€™ve learned about configuration, downloading the ISO, and basic commands:

    Basic Commands
ls -la: Displays details and hidden files.
cd /path/directory: Accesses a directory.
cd ..: Goes up one level.
cd ~: Moves to the user's home directory.
pwd: Shows the current directory.

    File and Directory Management
mkdir directory_name: Creates a new directory.
rm file.txt: Deletes a file.
rm -r directory_name/: Deletes a directory along with its contents.
cp file.txt destination/: Copies a file to the destination.
mv file.txt new_name.txt: Renames a file.
mv file.txt destination/: Moves a file to a directory.

    File Manipulation
cat file.txt: Displays the content of a file.
nano file.txt: Opens a text editor in the terminal.


I practiced these commands by creating folders/directories, moving, deleting, and editing files
