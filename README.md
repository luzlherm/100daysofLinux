# 100 Days of Code: Linux Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! My primary focus for this challenge is to dive deep into the world of Linux. At the moment, I am studying the Kali Linux distribution, which is widely known for its security tools and flexibility.
I am currently using Kali Linux on a Virtual Machine (VM), which allows me to experiment and learn without altering my primary operating system.

## Why Linux?

Linux is an incredibly powerful and versatile operating system that powers:

Servers: The backbone of the internet.

Embedded Systems: From smartphones to smart devices.

Developers' Workstations: A preferred OS for programming and software development.

## Key Advantages of Linux:

Open Source: Completely free to use and modify.

Security: Highly robust and less prone to malware.

Customizability: Tailor it to meet specific needs.

Community Support: A thriving global community for assistance.

Performance: Efficient resource utilization, even on older hardware.

These benefits make Linux an essential skill for developers, IT professionals, and enthusiasts. My motivation to study Linux stems from its practicality and vast applications in the tech world.

## Why 100 Days of Code?

The 100 Days of Code initiative is more than just a challenge—it’s a commitment. By sharing my progress daily, I am:

Holding myself accountable to stay consistent.

Creating a learning journal to track my growth.

Encouraging others to embark on their own coding journeys.

Posting updates regularly makes the learning process a habit and ensures I stay motivated throughout the journey.
